Author: Shubham Garg

This repo contains my project i.e. e-Sustain App which I developed for the competition. 
The repo contains a ppt which I submitted on 24-09-2022. As per the instructions we 
have the time to submit the code till Monday i.e. 26-09-2022, 4:00 PM (IST).

All the uploaded files i.e. ppt and the code are present in the repo, Since, I had completed the app on 24-09-2022 itself,
I have included the result screenshots in the ppt as well (submitted on 24-09-2022). Also, I have uploaded some more 
screenshots for better understanding of the project.

Note For the Code Part: Since, I have used the Microsoft Azure Powerapps platform to develop the app, due to its advanced nature, the designing part was done
by the azure power apps services, elimniating the need to write code. However, the functionality of the app with azure sql needed to be defined which I have 
developed and have attached in the code of the app.
